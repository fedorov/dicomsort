dicomsort
=========

A project to provide custom sorting and renaming of dicom files


Description
-----------

Given DICOM files in a random folder structure, this program copies all into a user-defined folder hierarchy, creating folders as necessary and changing DICOM file names to be more meaningful.

The user can define the target folder structure and file naming by using a string consisting of concatenated tag names (like 'PatientName'), underscores and slashes.
The last part of the string (as separated by slashes) denotes the naming convention for the file parts.

An Example: a target string of
 'Modality/PatientName_PatientID'
means that all DICOM images are arranged in a base folder and named by PatientName_PatientID,
followed by an underscore and a unique number for every file that falls into the same category (and is not the same..?)

dicomsort returns with a count for both DICOM files organized and non-DICOM (or invalid DICOM) files skipped.
It aborts with an error if it is to overwrite any existing file.


Usage
-----

```
% dicomsort.py --help
dicomsort [options...] sourceDir targetDir/<patterns>

 where [options...] can be:
    [-z,--compressTargets] - create a .zip file in the target directory
    [-d,--deleteSource] - remove source files/directories after sorting
    [-f,--forceDelete] - remove source without confirmation
    [-k,--keepGoing] - report but ignore dupicate target files
    [-v,--verbose] - print diagnostics while processing
    [-t,--test] - run the built in self test (requires internet)
    [--help] - print this message

 <patterns...> is a string defining the output file and directory
names based on the dicom tags in the file.

 Examples:

  dicomsort data sorted/%PatientName/%StudyDate/%SeriesDescription-%SOPInstanceUID.dcm

 could create a folder structure like:

  sorted/JohnDoe/2013-40-18/FLAIR-2.dcm

If patterns are not specified, the following default is used:

 %PatientName-%Modality%StudyID-%StudyDescription-%StudyDate/%SeriesNumber_%SeriesDescription-%InstanceNumber.dcm
 ```
